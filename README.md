Hi! My name is Angelo Gabriel Silveira, I'm 21 years old and currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at UNIFTEC. I'm passionate about technology and currently focusing on building a career in Quality Assurance (QA).

I love learning new things, stepping out of my comfort zone, and exploring how technology connects with human behavior, critical thinking, and real-world impact.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning QA fundamentals and automated testing with Cypress.
- 👀 I’m looking to connect with people working in software testing and quality assurance.
- 🤝 I’m open to collaborating on beginner-friendly QA projects.
